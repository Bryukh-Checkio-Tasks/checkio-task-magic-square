    In mathematics, a <strong>magic square</strong> is an arrangement of numbers
    (integers in our case) in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, and in
    each column, and the numbers in the forward and backward main diagonals, all
    add up to the same number.

<p>
    Given not completed magic square (with size from 3 to 5). You should finish it.
    It must be a <em>normal</em> magic square and contains integers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup> without repeating.
    The square is presented as a list of list with integers. Zero is a empty cell.
    You should return completed magic square. The task can have several solutions.
