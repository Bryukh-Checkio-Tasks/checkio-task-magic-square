    In mathematics a <strong>magic square</strong> is an arrangement of numbers
    (integers in our case) in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, each column and the numbers in the forward and backward main diagonals, all
    sum up to the same number.

<p>
    You have been given an incomplete magic square (with a size from 3 to 5). With your coding skills, you must finish the square.
    It must be a <em>normal</em> magic square and contain integers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup> without repeating.
    The square is presented as a list of lists with integers. Zero is used to mark an empty cell.
    You should return a completed magic square. The task may have multiple solutions.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a constraint satisfaction problem.
    It's used not only for solving puzzles, but also for planning and resource allocation in city planning,
    construction and just about everywhere else.
